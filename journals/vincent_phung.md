# Tuesday 11/22/2022

# Tuesday 11/29/2022
Today,
- We worked on the create letter for the frontend. We had trouble connecting it to the backend to make api call.
- We then realized it had something to do with the args that we were passing to the topic params

# Wednesday 11/30/2022
Today,
- We worked on auth as a group.
- There were many problems that popped up and because we didn't really get a clear enough demo on how to use the code given for the authenticator we decided to spend some time to research and continue tomorrow

Updated to do list:

- start deployment
- add unit tests
- finish logout button
- edit / hide nav bar
- filter letters per user


# Thursday 12/1/2022
Today,
- I started working on the edit letter page. I'm still not that familiar on how to use redux so I took some time playing around with it. After I was able to get the letters to display but couldn't edit it.
- Kim was nice enough and spent sometime helping me after class and taught me I had to store it in the redux query

# Friday 12/2/2022
Today, I worked on:
- hiding the items on navbar for the landing page and displaying the items only when the users are logged in
- had trouble understanding the redux code
- figured out I needed to move the providers and nest the routes I wanted to hide to the main page component
- started development with the group but because the instructions weren't really that clear we had trouble getting anything to work..

# Monday 12/5/2022
Today,
- We worked on development on render.com but we were only able to get one deployed
- I started to worked on the gitlab-ci.yml for our frontend deployment on gitlab


# Tuesday 12/6/2022 - Thursday 12/8/2022
We have been working on development for the last couple of days and we had to restart multiple times because the information we're getting kept changing...

This week was too much for me I was too lost with the render and different db stuff and didn't contribute much but watch the team and tried to follow along.

I was able to help with the .env and some of environment variables

# Friday 12/9/2022
- We got the frontend deployed on gitlab.
- I cleaned up the code for the users-service but ran into a git error when I tried to merge on git...
